# Health and Data-Science

# Whole body scans made in seconds

A medical imaging device that can create 3D renderings of the entire human body in as little as 20 seconds could soon be used for a wide variety of research and clinical applications.

# CRISPR babies

Lots of new articles about the use of CRISPR for genome editing in embryos. All has been a backlash of recent He Jiankui et al work on the editing of the HIV virus resistance gene CCR5 in china. Two embryos were implanted, and only one of the twins to have the modification.

Some of the most interesting articles I have read are:
My favourite. Explains mosaicism very well

# When everyone is worried about CIRSPR babies.. here is real genetic engineering of animals

* Reproductive biologists are developing an unusual way to produce farm animals with desirable traits: injecting surrogate fathers — whose own sperm production has been crippled by gene editing — with sperm-producing stem cells from another male that pass along ‘elite’ genes to offspring. From then on, the surrogate sire’s offspring will not be his own, but the donor’s.[Bull ‘super dads’ are being engineered to produce sperm from another father] (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00718-5)
*  In 2017, the researchers reported that they had used the gene-editing tool CRISPR–Cas9 to disable a gene called NANOS2 in pigs ([pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28071690))
* That same year, another team led by Michael McGrew of the University of Edinburgh’s Roslin Institute said it had created sterile female chickens using a different gene-editing system to disable a gene called DDX4 ([pubmed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28174243))
* Transgenic Technology Meeting in Kobe, Japan, Oatley plans to present additional data showing that he can achieve normal fertility in surrogate mouse sires, even when he transplants the sperm-producing stem cells from a genetically dissimilar strain of mice
